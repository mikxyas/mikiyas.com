## 🧗 Entrepreneurship

Interested in shipping small(well packaged) products that provide value to people

## ⚛️ Science and Technology

I break down science stuff in my blog. I believe that we aleady posses the capability
to build all the tech for the next 1000 years. I want to steal innovations and ideas from the future. Like Nikola Tesla for example. I know 
someone will discover some kind of gravity propulsion in the future but I want to steal their glory 😈

## 🛸 Sci-Fi Novels

I want to read all the classics. (currently cooking sth that will help me do that)
send me recommendations and short stories. 

## 🚀 e/acc 

Core philosophy: Speed is not enough you need Acceleration 🚀🚀🚀 
Vi < Vf => ♾️

## ☀️ I 💓 Sun

why you may ask? because the speed at which the sun radiates its energy is the literal limit of the universe. I always ask myself: Is what I'm doing the limit of the system that 
I am interacting with, most of the times the answer is less than 1%

## 💡 Philosophy

My philosophy is centered around the idea of limitless possibilities. 💫 I firmly believe that the only limit is our WILL.

### ⚡ Speed of Data

The that the internet will always be a profitable venture if we can move at the speed of data. 🌐
It will process and validate your idea or whatever you do on it at close to the speed of light. 
I see it as an organism. And I'm looking for more and more ways to interact with this "system"
